# Software-Development---Assignment-2

ACTIVITY 1 — Requirements / Creative Session (Custom Version for the Chat App)

1.1 Project Overview
This project is a real-time, mobile-friendly chat application designed for everyday communication. Unlike simple games like Hangman or Hide & Seek, a chat app has a wide range of real-world uses, making the project feel more practical and meaningful.

The application allows users to:
•	Enter a username
•	Send and receive messages instantly
•	View chat history
•	Experience a clean Twitter-inspired UI with optional dark/light mode
•	Use extra features like delete chat, auto-scroll, emoji support, and message colours
The goal is to create a lightweight tool that feels like something people could use daily.

1.2 Target Audience
The primary audience includes:
•	Students
•	Casual social media users
•	People who prefer simple, fast communication tools
They expect:
•	Quick message sending
•	Mobile responsiveness
•	A smooth UI like social media apps
•	A modern, familiar feel
